TEST QUESTION : What's the difference between a bush, a shrub, and a tree?
<br />
TEST ANSWER : Shrubs and trees are both specifically *woody* plants with stems that survive throughput the winter. A tree has a clear central trunk whereas a shrub has multiple stems rising from the ground.'Bush' is a more general term for any plant with multiple stems rising from the ground, and that can be either woody or what's called herbaceous, herbaceous plants are ones where the stems die back completely or substantially in the winter leaving the plant with just its roots and new stems grow next spring.
